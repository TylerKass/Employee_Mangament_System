Description: We start off with a menu method that prints out the menu. We then go into main to use all of our
other classes. We go to a do while loop like in MiniLab 2. Which then through all of our options. Option A adds an employee.
If you go above 5 employees the entire program quits and throws an exception because you added to many employees.
b. Lists the employees along with the salary or hourly wage along with what kind of employee they are. C gives
whatever employee you choose a raise. d gives paychecks to all employees. e you can change the hours of the hourly employees.
If you choose a non-hourly employee it will say no employee found. f quits along with a print message saying bye!
